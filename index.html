     The following pages contain a lesson in the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman process. The pages will take you through a series of steps from the beginning, all the way
     through encrypting
     and decrypting a message. The steps are highlighted on the left side of the screen. As you work through the process, keep in mind the values you are likely to use are much smaller
     than used in 'real' cryptograpy. Even using smaller values, the process is the same as used every day in security applications around the world.
     Throughout the process we will use the common example of users Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob want to share a message over a public network without anyone else
     being able to read the messages. Public and private keys for Alice will be represented with the greek letter &alpha; and A, while keys for Bob will be represented
     with the greek letter &beta; and B.
     At the end of lesson there will be an example of a commonly used Elliptic Curve for comparison. If you have issues with the material, please see your instructor
     for additional assistance. If you have any issue with the pages themselves,
     or find mistakes in the lesson, feel free to <a href="mailto:nick@southernct.edu?Subject=ECDH%20Web%20Lessons">email</a> me.<br><p>Thank you!

     Note!! I have tested theses pages on many browsers and with many operating systems. Microsoft Edge does not work due to an issue with the Javascript localStorage
     procedure. If you find issues with another browser, please let me know.<br>
